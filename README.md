# Mason's Mobile Phone Wallpaper Collection

I've collected these wallpapers over a number of years and have no idea where I got most of them. I've also renamed them all (giving them a number) so I don't even have their original filenames.

## Where Did I Get These?

I find wallpapers in a number of different locations, but good places to check out include [Imgur](http://imgur.com), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), [4chan](https://4chan.org/), and [Twitter](https://x.com/home).

## Ownership

Because I downloaded most of these from sites like Imgur, Reddit, and 4chan, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images.
